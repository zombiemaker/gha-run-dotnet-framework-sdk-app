# Microsoft-provided container images with .NET Framework SDKs are multi-gigabytes large - download and extraction times can take over 30-45 minutes

When creating GitHub Container Actions using Windows container images based on Microsoft Windows Server Core and .NET libraries and programs, the image sizes are so large that it takes over 45 minutes to download and extract them.  This makes it unusable when the GitHub Action Runners do not already have a local cache of the container image.

This is especially the case when using a GitHub-hosted action runner.
